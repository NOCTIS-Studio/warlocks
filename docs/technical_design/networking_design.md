# Networking Design

## Overview
This document outlines the networking architecture for multiplayer support in the game. It includes details on the communication protocols, data synchronization, and server architecture.

## Communication Protocols
- **Protocol**: UDP for real-time data exchange.
- **Data Serialization**: JSON for game state and player actions.
- **Encryption**: TLS/SSL for secure data transmission.

## Server Architecture
- **Server Type**: Dedicated server.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Manage game sessions and player connections.
  - Handle game state synchronization and updates.
  - Enforce game rules and match fairness.

## Client-Server Interaction
- **Client Actions**: Send player inputs, receive game state updates.
- **Server Actions**: Process inputs, update game state, broadcast state to clients.

## Data Synchronization
- **State Updates**: Regularly synchronized to ensure consistency across clients.
- **Lag Compensation**: Implemented to handle latency and provide a smooth experience.

## Future Considerations
- **Scalability**: Potential for expanding server infrastructure to handle more players.
- **Security**: Ongoing improvements to prevent cheating and exploits.
