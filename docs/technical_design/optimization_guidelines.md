# Optimization Guidelines

## Overview
This document provides guidelines and best practices for optimizing game performance, including rendering, scripting, and resource management.

## Rendering Optimization
- **Texture Atlases**: Combine multiple textures into a single atlas to reduce draw calls.
- **Level of Detail (LOD)**: Implement LOD techniques to reduce the complexity of distant objects.
- **Culling**: Use frustum culling to avoid rendering objects outside the camera view.

## Scripting Optimization
- **Avoiding Expensive Operations**: Minimize the use of costly operations in the main game loop.
- **Efficient Data Structures**: Use appropriate data structures for managing game objects and resources.
- **Profiling**: Regularly profile scripts to identify and address performance bottlenecks.

## Resource Management
- **Asset Bundling**: Bundle assets to reduce loading times and memory usage.
- **Memory Management**: Monitor and manage memory allocation to prevent leaks and fragmentation.
- **Pooling**: Implement object pooling to reuse objects and reduce garbage collection overhead.

## Network Optimization
- **Data Compression**: Compress data before transmission to reduce bandwidth usage.
- **Latency Management**: Use techniques to minimize the impact of network latency on gameplay.

## Future Considerations
- **Performance Testing**: Ongoing testing and optimization as new features are added.
- **Hardware Variability**: Ensure the game performs well across a range of hardware configurations.
