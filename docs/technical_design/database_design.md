# Database Design

## Overview
This document describes the database schema used to manage game data, including player information, game statistics, and item inventories.

## Schema
### Tables
- **`players`**
  - **Columns**: `id`, `username`, `email`, `password_hash`, `last_login`
  - **Purpose**: Stores player account information.

- **`game_stats`**
  - **Columns**: `player_id`, `games_played`, `games_won`, `highest_score`
  - **Purpose**: Tracks player performance and statistics.

- **`items`**
  - **Columns**: `id`, `name`, `type`, `effect`, `value`
  - **Purpose**: Manages item details and properties.

- **`upgrades`**
  - **Columns**: `id`, `name`, `type`, `level`, `cost`, `benefit`
  - **Purpose**: Stores information about item upgrades and enhancements.

## Relationships
- **`players` to `game_stats`**: One-to-One (each player has one set of stats).
- **`players` to `items`**: Many-to-Many (players can have multiple items, items can be owned by multiple players).
- **`items` to `upgrades`**: One-to-Many (items can have multiple upgrades).

## Database Access
- **Database Engine**: PostgreSQL
- **Access Methods**: SQL queries for CRUD operations.
- **Backup and Recovery**: Regular backups and disaster recovery plans.

## Future Considerations
- **Scaling**: Optimization strategies for handling large amounts of data.
- **Security**: Measures to protect player data and prevent unauthorized access.
