# Gameplay Mechanics

## Core Mechanics
1. **Movement**: 
   - Players move their characters using directional inputs (WASD or arrow keys).
   - Characters have a fixed movement speed and can dodge using a special action.

2. **Spellcasting**:
   - Players have access to a spellbook with 4 base spells: Fireball, Teleport, Shield, and Lightning.
   - Spells consume mana, which regenerates slowly over time.

3. **Mana System**:
   - Each spell costs a certain amount of mana. Mana regeneration is slow, encouraging strategic use of spells.
   - Mana regenerates faster when players are not casting spells.

4. **Health and Damage**:
   - Players have a health pool. Once their health reaches 0, they are eliminated from the round.
   - Damage dealt by spells and items varies based on type and level (e.g., Fireball deals 20 base damage).

5. **Arena Dynamics**:
   - Arenas may contain hazards such as traps or falling obstacles.
   - Some arenas may shrink over time, forcing players into close quarters.

## Win Condition
The last player standing in the arena wins the round. Points are awarded based on performance (kills, assists, surviving time).

## Game Flow
1. Players enter the lobby and select their wizards and items.
2. The game proceeds through multiple rounds, with players fighting in different arenas.
3. Between rounds, players can purchase upgrades and items to improve their abilities for the next round.
