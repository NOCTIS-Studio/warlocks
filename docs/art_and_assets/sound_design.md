# Sound Design Document

## Audio Style
The sound design will complement the pixel art visuals by using retro-inspired sound effects. This includes:
- **Chiptune-inspired sounds**: For both the UI and in-game actions (attacks, movements).
- **Atmospheric sounds**: Lo-fi, ambient soundscapes that fit the pixel art world without overwhelming it.
- **Music**: 8-bit or 16-bit music tracks, likely looping background themes for menus and battles.

## Sound Effects (SFX)
- **Character actions**:
  - Walk: Subtle step sounds, randomized for variety.
  - Attack: Distinct, sharp sounds for spells and melee.
  - Death: Retro distortion or a low-pitched fade-out sound.

- **Environmental sounds**:
  - Water: Simple bubbling or flowing effects.
  - Wind: Light, ambient wind sounds for outdoor levels.

- **UI sounds**:
  - Button clicks: Simple "beep" sounds with varying pitches for selection and confirmation.
  - Error notifications: Higher-pitched sound to indicate errors or blocked actions.

## File Format
- **Format**: All audio files will be in `.wav` format for the highest quality.
- **Length**: Effects should be concise (0.5 - 2 seconds) to keep gameplay flow intact.
