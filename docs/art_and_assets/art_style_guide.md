# Art Style Guide

## Overview
The art style for our game will be **pixel art**, a retro-inspired aesthetic that provides a visually appealing yet accessible design. While pixel art is the foundation, the style may evolve over time to include additional elements or adjustments.

## Resolution and Scale
- **Base resolution**: 32x32 pixels per tile or sprite.
- **Scale**: All in-game assets will be scaled to maintain clarity and readability on various screen sizes. Assets will typically be scaled 3x (96x96) for full screen display.

## Color Palette
- **Primary palette**: We'll use a limited 16-color palette to maintain consistency across all sprites and environments. This palette may expand as needed.
- **Shading**: Use 3 shades per color (light, medium, dark) to create depth without overcomplicating the sprite design.
- **Contrast**: High contrast between characters, backgrounds, and UI elements to ensure visual clarity.

## Style Guidelines
- **Characters**: Simplified yet expressive, focusing on readable silhouettes. Animation will focus on key actions.
- **Environment**: Minimalist but detailed enough to evoke immersion. Use patterns to fill large spaces and give a sense of texture.
- **UI**: Pixel-based with simple geometric shapes. Avoid overuse of complex textures to keep a clean aesthetic.
